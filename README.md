# Introduction to producing allometric equations from linear models
  ## Featuring light data wrangling, log-transformations, and error quantifications
  
This repository is dedicated to a tutorial that shows how to extract model coefficients to create an allometric equation including error quantification. 

- Datasets as either excel or csv can be found in [this folder](https://github.com/luisasenecio/Allometric-equations-from-linear-models/tree/main/Data)
- The tutorial and an example script can be found in [this folder](https://github.com/luisasenecio/Allometric-equations-from-linear-models/tree/main/Tutorial)
- And finally, all figures and outputs that we're producing in the example script can be found [here](https://github.com/luisasenecio/Allometric-equations-from-linear-models/tree/main/Outputs)

Good luck!
